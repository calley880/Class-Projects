# What is ECE 3050
ECE 3050 is Circuits and Electronics II, a follow-up course to ECE 2050, which was Circuits and Electronics I (introductory circuit class). 
It involves the continuation of circuit analysis and the construction as well as testing of circuits involving diodes, MOSFET amplifers, transistors, and more.
# Purpose of this repository
