# Project Description
In this project (part 2 of 2), we were tasked to build a sequence detector using a Finite State Machine (FSM).
D flip-flops were used to store the circuit's states as well as LEDs to visualize the sequence detected.
The sequence detector is lights the LED when the whole sequence (0001) is detected from the sequence generator from part 1.
There are more details involving this project in the assignment file as well as the part 2 project report.
